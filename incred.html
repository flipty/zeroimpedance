<p><b>Mike Currie, Atma-Sphere S-30 amp and Quad ESL-63 speakers:<br>
</b>&quot;I guess I have been among the most skeptical in thinking that ZEROs would 
do nothing for my Quads given that speaker's impedance curve. Though I've had 
them set up for only a couple of days now, it is apparent that I was quite 
mistaken. The most profound difference is in the mid and upper bass, which has 
both tightened up and has become more 'organic'. I never have figured out what 
the latter term really means in sound reproduction, but I guess you know it when 
you hear it. Deep cello and double bass simply sound more real - and they 
sounded pretty damn good to begin with. Two days do not a long term partner 
make, but I can say right now that unless some strange deleterious effects show 
up unexpectedly, this is the best 'tweak' money I've ever spent. 
Congratulations, Paul!&quot; Mike</p>
<p>&quot;The more I listen to the system with the ZEROS in, the more I like them. 
Please note that this applies to my new M-60s just as much as my former S-30. 
This is a great product and a true bargain.&quot;</p>
<p><b>Jay Min (California), Tenor 75WP OTL Amplifier and Amati Homage Speakers 
(4 ohms):<br>
</b>&quot;Dear Paul, Got the ZERO-Boxes. Talk about return on investment. It just has 
to be the best $1K I've spent considering all the money that I have blown in the 
past 30 years. I only played with them for about 5 hours and can't wait till 
they are fully broken in. I am still debating between 3X and 4X and at the 
moment I am inclined to use the 4X despite that the mid bass is just a hint 
drier than I would like. I have the Amati Homage (nominal 4ohm with a dip of 1 
ohm at about 400Hz) driven by Tenor 75WP. The Zero really brings out the best of 
the OTL, of Tenor in term of airiness and openness while retaining excellent 
control of the bass. I was inches away from dumping the Amati but the ZEROs 
sorta save its day. I believe I have talked a few of my fellow audiophiles into 
giving it a shot. Thanks.... Jay&quot;</p>
<p><b>Gary Susott (Kansas), Cary V12 (Push-Pull) amplifier and Magenpan 1.6 
speakers (4 ohms):<br>
</b>&quot;Paul, Just thought I would let you know the ZEROs arrived yesterday and I'm 
a happy customer. I didn't have much time to experiment or listen last night, 
but the initial results were very impressive. I set up my amp and the ZEROs to 
double the damping factor because the Cary amp has a high output impedance, a 
little more than half the tap value, I understand. A whole new world of bass 
clarity appeared. This was not at all subtle. I was hearing surprising bass 
depth, space, air, and delineation I never heard before. The overall listening 
experience was quite improved. I'll have more time to experiment over the 
weekend. It's been a pleasure.&quot;</p>
<p><b>Tim Kirkpatrick (Georgia), Atma-Sphere MA-1 Mk II.2s and Spendors speakers 
(8 ohm):<br>
</b>&quot;Well, Paul, I was skeptical. I really wasn't sure that the ZEROs would 
improve my nominally 8 Ohm speakers. Boy, was I wrong! I'm using the 2X tap to 
make the MA-1s think they are driving 16 ohm speakers. The ZEROs are everything 
you advertised them to be--tighter more defined bass, improved mid-range detail, 
and extended highs. All in all, the ZEROs just provide a much more realistic 
reproduction of the recorded event. I am a thoroughly satisfied customer, and I 
will pass the good word along. Thanks again for a great product! By the way, the 
ZEROs in the cherry case match my Spendors perfectly and actually look to be 
part of the original speaker. Take care!&quot; TK</p>
<p><b>Gerald Rankine-Galloway (District of Columbia), Conrad-Johnson Evolution 
2000 amp (SS) and Infinity Kappa Speakers (4-6 ohms):<br>
</b>&quot;Dear Paul, The ZEROs did arrive yesterday, I have them connected, and they 
sound quite wonderful at 3x. The best way to characterize them at this early 
stage is to say that they impart a remarkable sense of meaning and 
intelligibility to the musical message. Suddenly voices and instruments breathe 
as they should, and the system disappears.&quot; Gerald</p>
<p><b>Joe Ranium (Hong Kong):<br>
</b>&quot;Paul, I am very impressed with the ZERO-Autoformers and will be taking two 
more for my two other systems, but will defer the purchase for 2 months as I 
have spent quite a lot on hi-fi this month. Will be in touch in due course. Best 
regards, Joe&quot;</p>
<p><b>Manuel Vidal (Puerto Rico), Transcendent OTL and Soliloquy 5.3 Speakers 
(90dB, 8 ohm):<br>
</b>&quot;If you want to know what difference a 16 ohm impedance speaker sounds like 
with our OTL's give Paul Speltz' Zero's a try. I tried various taps and found 
that the X2 impedance multiplier sounds the best. My speakers are the 
Soliloquy's 5.3, which are an easy 8 ohm load, thus making it a 16 ohm load. 
This set up was sounding perfectly well, I thought, until I heard the Zero's. My 
preamp is a GG built from scratch and the Bel Canto Design DAC driven by a Sony 
7700 DVD/CD player. After evaluating the Zero's I am not sending them back. 
Every aspect of the reproduction is enhanced, specially in the smoothness 
department. All the resolution,detail retrieval and dynamic aspects are kept but 
with much more refinement. The stage is also bigger. I don't really know if this 
is exactly as driving a 16 ohm speaker, but I am pretty sure it's very close. 
According to the designer, adding this device does not defeat the OTL's prime 
design purpose of not having an OPT, though this device works differently to an 
OPT.&quot;</p>
<p><b>Stew Glick (New York), Wright/Sound 3.5 2A3 SET amps, driving Quad ESL63 
speakers:<br>
</b>&quot;Paul, I received the ZEROs, thanks! I put them into my system and even 
though they are not even broken in yet, I heard an immediate improvement in my 
stereo. I used the 4x setting on my Wright/Sound 3.5 2A3 amps, driving Quad 
ESL63 speakers. The bass is deep and VERY tight, plucked strings have more of a 
percussive sound, and the sound is cleaned up overall....it really makes me 
shake my head in disbelief that I am getting this kind of sound out of a pair of 
3-8 watt 2A3 amps. (I do also use a Hsu VTF-2 sub, but any changes I am hearing 
is coming from the speakers as the sub is driven via the preamp outputs). At 
this time I have no desire to check out other settings, as 4x is pretty high and 
I am not hearing any thinness or the like. I feel like I am getting the most out 
of the ZEROs with no negative effects as they are set up now. Thanks for you 
help and friendly assistance.&quot; Stew</p>
<p>&quot;I'm still very impressed with the sound of my stereo since adding the zeros 
into the equation. Everything sounds so natural, effortless, organic. Thanks for 
your help.&quot; Stew Glick</p>
<p><b>Jose M. Rodriguez (Puerto Rico), Naim M1.1 (Solid State) amplifier and 
Parsifal speakers (8 ohm):<br>
</b>&quot;Hi Paul, Had heard a bit about the ZEROs, but a couple of days ago got a 
pair on loan and tried them in my system. WOW, never had anything brought so 
much improvement to it. Work best with 2x setting. Do you have ZEROs&nbsp; 
available? Thanks.&quot; Regards, Jose</p>
<p><b>Greg Gresham (South Carolina), Rogue 88 (Push-Pull 6550s) and Inersound 
Isis electrostat speakers (4 ohm):<br>
</b>&quot;Paul, I just wanted to get back with you on the ZEROs in my setup, they 
worked GREAT, they sound there best in the 2.75x tap. I could not believe how 
much better this system is with the ZEROs, you hear all the music that seemed to 
get lost in the mix before , I have emailed a few people on the web site 
Audiogon and told them about this product, well done Paul well done.&quot; Greg</p>
<p><b>Andy Timmons (Maryland), Joule Electra VZN-80 amplifier and 4 ohm Magnepan 
speakers:<br>
</b>&quot;Thanks for remembering me Paul, Since we last talked, I was able to borrow&nbsp; 
and then purchase my friends pair of original ZEROs. Once again my Maggies 
sounded so much better with the ZEROs in-line, but my curiosity still begged the 
question, how would the ZEROs sound directly connected to my Joule VZN-80. Well, 
after moving my speakers very close to the amp and re-connecting the ZEROs 
direct, I got my answer. The system sounded its best with the ZEROs alone. I 
didn't realize how quick, accurate and focused the ZEROs could be, and with 
absolutely no degrading of the sonics.&nbsp; The soundstage is tighter, more 
natural and the speakers have truly disappeared. For me it's the only way to run 
my system.</p>
<p><b>Luis Ponce Leao (Portugal), Atma-Sphere M-50 and B&amp;W N805 4 ohm Speakers:<br>
</b>&quot;The result was very impressive! The sound opened in way I really didn't 
expect... a huge soundstage, incredible dynamics and FOCUS, something I always 
missed on my system. This was particularly notorious with orchestras that really 
didn't seem to &quot;fit&quot; on my speakers.&quot; Luis</p>
<p><b>John Jansky (Minnesota), Audio Research VTM 200 amps and Wisdom Audio 
Adrenaline D-75's (4 ohms):<br>
</b>&quot;Hi Paul, I am really enjoying the new version of the ZEROs . The improved 
leads do make a significant difference on my mid-range/ high frequency towers. I 
have not yet used them on the low frequency drivers. I think I'd like to upgrade 
one pair for now. I'm using Audio Research VTM 200 amplifiers on a pair of 
Wisdom Audio Adrenaline D-75's. The speakers are 4 ohm and I'm using the 2x 
configuration with the 8 ohm output of the amplifiers. The sound is considerably 
richer with more low level detail.&quot;</p>
<p><b>Bill Layer (Minnesota), Atma-Sphere M-60 amps and 8 ohm speakers:<br>
</b>&quot;I've applied a set of ZEROs to my (very) original Atma-Sphere M-60 MK.II&nbsp; 
OTL amps, and felt like sharing my pleasure with these devices. Simply put, the 
Zero and the M-60 are a match made in the stars.. I never thought that hanging a 
piece of iron off the back was anything like correct, but I was happily wrong on 
that point. Though my speakers are a nominal 8-ohm load, and have reasonable 
efficiency - 94dB - the ZEROs puts more controlled power into this system than I 
thought possible. With the ZEROs at 2x, not only is the bass notably more 
authoritative, but every other part of the range seems to derive benefit as 
well. Not to mention that I am getting about 50% more power, overall - the M-60 
really wants to see 16ohm load - and that's what it gets from the ZEROs. With 
the full tube complement, truly antisocial volume levels are just a volume knob 
away - gone is the&nbsp; loosened bass and occasional stridency that I would get 
in the past, when I really pushed the system to the rails. With half the tube 
compliment, and the ZEROs at 4x, this system remains extremely musical, while 
still delivering excellent levels. I can say for a fact, that I will *never* be 
without a set of ZEROs for as long as I own my M-60s, and it goes without saying 
that will be for a very, very, long time. In terms of hardware design, quality, 
etc, the ZEROs are nothing other than a perfect compliment to Atma-Sphere 
equipment... and that is saying a *lot*. With Paul's very reasonable demo 
policy, you really have nothing to lose in trying out a set - and so much to 
gain. I hope these comments will help steer you down the path to more music. 
-Bill Layer&quot;</p>
<p><b>Scott Bayne, B&amp;K M200s (SS Mono Blocks) running into Carver AL-III+ 
speakers:<br>
</b>&quot;Paul, I just installed the ZEROs. I've got to say the improvement is&nbsp; 
dramatic. Thanks for a great product.&quot;</p>
<p><b>Robert A. Ettema (Ohio), Decware SET amplifier:<br>
</b>&quot;Dear Paul; The ZEROs arrived yesterday and the first impression is&nbsp; 
WHOWWWWWW ! Thanks, Best regards, Robert A. Ettema&quot;</p>
<p><b>Adam Berusch (Colorado), Atma-Sphere amps and Martin Logan CLS IIz 
Speakers (1-4 ohm):<br>
</b>&quot;THE SOUND: Incredible!!! Even after a very informal setup, the imaging, 
detail, transparency (etc) was really something. I had assumed that there would 
be little or no bass. Well, I gotta tell ya, the bass was very strong down to 
just under 40hz in my smallish room. I have extensive experience with Magnepan, 
Sound Lab, and Avant Garde, and this combo blows those others away! This is the 
kind of pleasant surprise audiophiles look forward to, but rarely get. I did not 
notice any anomalies in sound with the ZEROs installed. I tested the sound using 
a variety of sources, including the XLO test disk and The Absolute! Sound space 
CD. The sound passed all the tests impressively. Paul - You sir are a mad man! 
It's people like you that make this industry far more interesting. Job well 
done!&quot; -Adam</p>
