<P><font size="2">Low impedance speakers are not a good match for small amplifiers, especially 
vacuum tube Output Transformer Less (OTL) designs, but that was the combination 
I found myself living with a few years ago. The basic problem at hand was that 
the woofers were electrically under damped which caused a bloated sounding bass. 
After considering and trying a few obvious solutions, I used an autoformer to 
transform my low impedance speakers to high impedance speakers. This increased 
the amp to speaker damping factor. I found that in addition to the expected 
results, some unexpected benefits. </font>
<P><font size="2"><B>Mismatch Troubles<BR></B>
As a veteran speaker builder, with the experience 
of roughly 10 different speaker designs built from scratch, I had essentially 
settled into a speaker design I was happy with.&nbsp; I was running a 3-way 
system using Dynaudio and Peerless drivers making a nominal 4.7-ohm load speaker 
system. Being content with my speakers, I started exploring amplifiers, which 
lead me to tube amps, and then OTL tube amps. By definition, my OTL amp's output 
tubes need to directly handle the low 4.7-ohm impedance load of my speakers. I 
would have been set if I had previously designed and build a 16-ohm speaker 
system that would have been more OTL friendly. </font>
<P><font size="2">Isn't this just how it goes some times; I spent years designing, building, 
changing, tweaking, and then finally settling in and loving my DIY speakers. 
Then I borrowed a friend's OTL tube amps. Even though the OTLs didn't properly 
dampen the 4 ohm Peerless woofers, music poured out of these amps and brought 
life to the music in a way that there was just no going back to a more 
traditional/popular amplifier design. I knew I had to build myself a kit pair of 
Atma-Sphere M-60 OTL mono blocks (no longer available in kit form). </font>
<P><font size="2">I considered kicking off another speaker project, this time a 16-ohm design, 
but I was never able to build up enough steam to take it past the concept stage. 
I had already experienced the benefits of no feedback in tube amplifiers, so I 
was unwilling to increase the damping factor of the amps that way. I instead 
decide to address the overly blooming bass with a bigger OTL amp. This would 
lower the amp's output impedance and raise the damping factor. I did this by 
building up my M-60 kit using larger output power supplies, and loading up each 
amp with 8ea 6336B tubes per channel in place of the stock 6AS7 tubes. Each 
6336B tube is roughly equal to two stock 6AS7 tube so I had essentially doubled 
the amp. With the "hot rod" amp biased at 1 amp, I achieved the woofer control 
as expected. The ability to flow twice as much current gave me 4 times more 
output power as well. This worked out well all winter, but with about 1200 watts 
of heat being dumped into the room, I wanted a different solution for the summer 
time. </font>
<P><font size="2"><B>Autoformer Ideas<BR></B>
After hearing that autoformers had been used to 
drive extremely low impedance (1-2 ohm) speakers, I tried a wild experiment. I 
had sitting in my basement a pair of 300VA 50-60Hz toroidal power transformers. 
I figured out how to configure them into a 2:1 winding ratio autoformer. This 
would give me a 4:1 impedance ratio and enable me to transform my 4.7-ohm 
speakers into 18.8-ohm speakers. I was quite surprised at how well they worked. 
Running them full range I could hear an increase in bass control, and the high 
frequency was only a bit squirrly. I felt that the bass could get even better if 
I could get a lower DC resistance value on the autoformer, and the highs would 
clean up if the autoformer was actually designed for audio. I also tried the 
same experiment with a 50-60 Hz EI core power transformer, but the results were 
poor. The EI transformer had no frequency extension. It liked to run only in the 
50-60 Hz region that it was designed for. </font>
<P><font size="2">Further pursuit of autoformers gained me a used pair of Atma-Sphere Z-Music 
(Auto) Transformers. New units were no longer available, so I felt lucky to get 
them. These really worked out well. I used them to make my speakers high enough 
impedance that now during the summer months I could run the amps with ½ the 
stock tubes instead of my double sized version. One of the hardest pills to 
swallow for an OTL amplifier lover, like myself, is adding "iron" to the system. 
But since I liked them, I left them connected to my speakers through the summer.
</font>
<P><font size="2"><B>Autoformer Basics<BR></B>In general, a power transformer is 
used to transform voltage and current. An audio transformer is used to transform 
impedance, but both are really doing the same thing. The winding with more turns 
will have more voltage, less current, or higher impedance. The winding with 
fewer turns will have less voltage, more current, or lower impedance. A typical 
audio transformer has a &quot;primary&quot; winding and a &quot;secondary&quot; winding. For 
example, a tube amp transformer may be used to convert a 10k ohm plate-to-plate 
impedance to a 4-ohm impedance for driving a 4-ohm speaker. To achieve this 
10k:4 impedance ratio, a 50:1 winding ratio is required. This is because there 
is a square root relationship between the impedance ratio and the winding ratio 
in a transformer. This typical transformer also provides electrical isolation 
from primary to secondary so that the output can be electrically floated. </font> 
<P><font size="2">An "auto-transformer" or "autoformer" is the simplest type of transformer. An 
autoformer has only one winding with multiple taps available. The impedance 
conversion is achieved by bringing the audio signal out on a different set of 
taps than the audio came in on. An autoformer can be used anytime electrical 
isolation is not required. The same impedance ratio to windings ratio rules 
apply, that is the winding ratio is the square root of the impedance ratio 
required. So an impedance ratio of 4:1 (16 ohms:4 ohms) would be achieved with a 
winding ratio of the square root of 4, so 2:1 winding ratio. </font>
<P><font size="2">Another way to think of an autoformer is to imagine a typical tube amp output 
transformer with the primary windings removed. There is only the output 
secondary winding with 16 ohm, 8 ohm, 4 ohm, and common taps. Now connect a 
4-ohm speaker on the 4-ohm tap, and it will be reflected as a 16-ohm load on the 
16-ohm tap. I tried using a typical tube amp transformer as an autoformer, but 
as expected, there was a serious lack of low frequency energy transferred since 
the transformer was not designed to be used in this manner. </font>
<P><font size="2"><b>The Autoformer Advantage</b><BR>There are a few general advantages an 
autoformer has over a typical transformer. I usually feel that simpler is 
better, and I think it applies in this case. With only one winding, the music 
has the advantage of coming out on the same winding that it goes in on, instead 
of having to totally pass from the primary winding to the secondary winding. I 
believe that removing the need for the entire audio signal to leap over the 
electrical isolation of a typical transformer allows for a much greater transfer 
of the low level information resolved in the music. </font>
<P><font size="2">Second, the autoformer is &quot;dry&quot;; meaning it is not &quot;soaked&quot; 
with DC bias current. Accommodating DC current in general limits the frequency 
extremes. More &quot;iron&quot; needs to be added to keep the core from saturation and a 
transformer needs to be even larger to do bass well. This larger size tends to 
limit high frequency extension due to an increase in inductance, so some middle 
of the road compromise is decided upon. I am not a transformer engineer, but I 
think I am safe in stating these generalities. As an example, a SET transformer 
will typically have a more limited frequency response than a P-P transformer, 
because it is dealing with greater DC current demands. </font>
<P><font size="2">Third, the impedance ratio is very small. There is only a 16-ohm to 4-ohm 
conversion, not a 10,000-ohm to 4-ohm conversion. This makes the autoformer's 
job much simpler, making things like frequency extension, linearity, 
transparency, etc. even easier. </font>
<P><font size="2"><b>The ZEROs Story</b><BR>The summer went by and still feeling good about the 
used autoformers, I responded to a call for help from an OTL'er with the same 
OTL amps connected to low impedance speakers. Since the Z-Music Transformers 
were still not available, I pitched out the idea on the Atma-Sphere Owner's 
Group (ASOG, visit <A href="http://www.otlamp.com/" target="main">http://www.otlamp.com/</A> ) 
that if a few guys are interested, I would "roll my own" autoformer for them. 
There was enough interest, so I took on the challenge. From my earlier 
experiments, I decided the autoformer would have a toroidal core. The ability 
for audio to pass through a toroidal transformer that was designed for 50-60Hz 
power impressed me. I also knew I was only capable of specifying the design 
requirements. </font>
<P><font size="2">After two or three weeks of investigation, I found an audio transformer 
engineer willing and capable of the task. I specified the frequency response, DC 
resistance, impedance of each tap, maximum power, etc. The transformer engineer 
needed to find the proper combination of core size, core material, wire size, 
number of windings, etc., to fulfill my design requirements. I was intuitive 
enough to set the requirements high so that there could be a large fluctuation 
in operation conditions and have it still function properly. The transformer 
engineer was smart enough to implement ideas such as using multiple smaller 
gauge wires wound together to gain the lower skin effect of the smaller wire, 
but still have the low DC resistance of a larger wire. A few weeks later I had 
my prototypes and nick named the pair of big round autoformers the "ZEROs".
</font>
<P><font size="2"><b>Evaluating the Prototype ZEROs</b><BR>I needed to make sure that first, 
the prototypes achieve the sonic benefits of multiplying the impedance of the 
speaker load, and second, they do this without showing any sonic signatures of 
their own. For three days I simply ran them on my system, played a lot of music 
and listened for any sonic clues that told me that I added "iron" to the system.
</font>

<P><font size="2">I invited myself over to my friend Joe's house and ran them on his excellent 
system which include Atma-sphere MP-3 preamp and MA-1 mkII amps, and a pair of 
top of the line Magnepan MG20 speakers. Joe was hoping for better bass from his 
Maggies. Using the ZEROs as an impedance doubler (2x) to make the 4-ohm Maggies 
feel like 8-ohms to the amps, it took about 3 seconds to hear that the bass had 
come out of the background and became a balanced part of the rest of the music. 
Joe was thrilled and commended, "I'm sold, count me in". </font>
<P><font size="2">What we started noticing next, was an overall improvement top to bottom. A 
nice drop in distortion and an increase in resolution made it easier to hear a 
lot more of everything that was happening in the recording. This was not subtle 
either. We both quite quickly noticed and described to each other the same 
things. </font>
<P><font size="2">After some time, we tried using the ZEROs as an impedance quadrupler (4x) to 
make the 4-ohm Maggies feel like 16-ohms to the amps. This time the improvement 
was a little more of the same. If the 2x gave us 5 steps forward, then the 4x 
gave us just 1 step more beyond that. Yet it was enough for Joe to say that he 
plans on using them that way. In the 3 hours of listening with them on Joe's 
system, we were unable to hear any problems with the "ZEROs". </font>
<P><font size="2">In an attempt to find out if the ZEROs were truly transparent, I listened to 
music on my system back and forth with them in and out, but compensating for the 
impedance change of the ZEROs by pulling output tubes. In other words 8ea 6336B 
tubes per amp biased up to 1 Amp directly connected to my 4.7 ohm speakers, 
compared to, 2ea 6336B tubes per amp biased at 250mA with the ZEROs used as a 4x 
speaker impedance multiplier. The thought here is that 1/4th the tubes at 1/4th 
the bias current driving what feels like 1/4th the load should sound exactly the 
same if the autoformers are truly transparent. Well, not only were the ZEROs 
utterly transparent, I have to say the music with just 2 tubes running through 
the ZEROs sounded a little cleaner in the bass, and the highs were better 
focused. </font>
<P><font size="2">I declared the prototypes a success, and had enough ZEROs made up for all the 
guys that wanted a pair. </font>
<P><font size="2"><B>The ZEROs Stretch Their Legs<BR></B>
The first batch of ZEROs hit the 
streets, and everybody seemed to love them. Then a second wave of interest came, 
so I ordered a second batch. It seemed as though people liked them so much they 
told their friends about them and also tried them on many different types of 
amplifiers. Just 16 months since the prototypes and I had shipped six batches of 
ZEROs all over the United States and other countries including: Canada, England, 
Turkey, Sweden, Scotland, Australia, Portugal, Holland, Puerto Rico, Malaysia, 
Italy, Greece, Spain and Thailand. </font>
<P><font size="2">The benefits of driving a higher impedance load seem to go beyond OTL 
amplifiers. I have been told by ZEROs users that they gained sonic improvements 
on Atma-Sphere (OTL), Transcendent Sound (OTL &amp; P-P), VAC (P-P), BAT (P-P), 
Audio Research (P-P), Bel Canto (SET and SS), LAMM (P-P), Joule-Electra (OTL), 
Meitner (solid state), Wright/Sound (SET), Cary (P-P and SS), Tenor (OTL), 
Carver (SS), Jolida (P-P), SONY (SS), NAIM (SS), Rogue (P-P), Futterman (OTL), 
Graaf (OTL), Decware "Zen" (SET), and some DIY (SET) VTL (P-P), McIntosh (P-P), 
Forte (SS), Manley (P-P), McCormakc (SS), Odyssey (SS), Monarchy (SS), Wolcott, 
Dyna, (P-P), Sonic Frontiers (P-P) and Welborne (SET).&nbsp; It just 
seems as though most amplifiers sound better when they are driving a higher 
impedance load. </font>
<P><font size="2">Although the ZEROs have been used with many amplifiers, I don't consider the 
ZEROs an amplifier tweak; I consider them a speaker tweak. The ZEROs have been 
used to increase the impedance of a large variety of manufactured speakers 
including: Magnepan, nOrh, B&amp;W, Dynaudio, Carver, PBN, Merlin, Martin-Logan, 
QUAD, Klipsch, SoundLab, Silverline, Vandersteen, Audiostat, Soliloquy, Cabasse, 
N.E.A.R., Waveform, Shamrock Audio, Audio Physic, Spendor, JM Lab, InnerSound, 
KEF, Medowlark, Alon, Galo, EV, Montanna, Triangle, Wisdon, Quadrature, Foxtex, 
Spendor, Omega, Infinity, VMPS, Newform Research, Dayton/Write, Parsifal, Horn 
Shoppe, Omega, Definitive, Thiel, Bertagni, Oskar, Sonus Faber, Dakini, Swan and Wilson Audio. </font>
<P><font size="2">Typical reported improvements from people who used the ZEROs to increase 
their speaker's impedance are: </font>
<blockquote>
  <ol type="A">
    <li><font size="2">Lower distortion</font></li>
    <li><font size="2">Firmer bass</font></li>
    <li><font size="2">Higher resolution</font></li>
    <li><font size="2">More extended and better-focused high frequency</font></li>
    <li><font size="2">Natural, effortless, and organic </font></li>
    </ol>
    </blockquote>
<P><font size="2">The combination of lower distortion, higher resolution, and more extended / 
better-focused highs often resulted in a larger soundstage with better imaging. 
Greater dynamics and an increase in the instrument's tactile texture seemed to 
improve as well. <a href="incred.html" target="main"><u>Click here</u></a> 
for a complete list of testimonial field reports. </font>
<P><font size="2"><B>Why?<BR></B> 
I have to ask myself why does increasing the impedance of a 
speaker lead to such globally common reported improvements. It goes against my 
audio philosophy that adding an extra component in the signal path can bring the 
listener closer to the original musical event. It must be the component added 
can provide greater benefits than "penalty". I believe the ZEROs are very 
transparent so the penalty is small. Imagine the power of "magically" changing 
the impedance of your speakers. What's left are the gains the amplifier and 
wires provide when driving an easier load. I can not prove anything, but I 
suspect it is simply easier for an amplifier and speaker wire to generate and 
transfer voltage than current. One watt into 4 ohms requires 2 volts at ½ amp of 
current. One watt into 16 ohms requires 4 volts at 1/4 amp of current. That's 
twice the voltage and half the current for the same amount of power. </font> 
<P><font size="2">Running high voltage / low current lines are a necessity for both the power 
utilities (high voltage power lines) and commercial audio installers (70v paging 
systems) where high voltage / low current is generated, distributed, and then 
transformed to lower voltage / higher current when it has arrived to its 
destination. The advantages of running low current lines are well understood, so 
it makes sense to apply it to our hobby as well. </font>
<P><font size="2"><b>Add a Resistor?</b><BR>If amplifiers and speaker cables like to drive 
higher impedance loads, why can't I simply add a large 10-ohm power resistor in 
series with my 4-ohm speaker? That approach will lighten up the load on the 
amplifier, but bring back the original problem of an electrically under damped 
woofer which caused a bloated sounding bass, and over 2/3 of the audio power 
will be lost as heat into the resister as well. </font>
<P><font size="2"><b>Some Final Thoughts</b><BR>I will never tire of hearing the enthusiasm of 
fellow audio hobbyist as they report the sonic improvements gained by simply 
increasing the impedance of their speakers using the ZEROs autoformers. Even 
8-ohm loads are not optimal. Half of the ZEROs owners used them to increase the 
impedance of their 8-ohm speakers. <b>Multiplying the reported best sounding ZEROs 
multiplication factor times the original speaker's impedance, and then averaging 
all the results, I found the average reported optimal impedance to be 14.6-ohms.

      <p><I><font size="2"><b>The Industry Mistake</b><BR>I feel the speaker industry has 
made a mistake migrating from the vintage norm 16-ohm speaker to today's short 
circuit designs. (A couple of obvious offenders are the Apogee Scintilla 1-ohm 
design and the Apogee Duettas Signatures with a stated manufacturer's impedance 
of 3/4 ohms) I think this has happened because a 4-ohm speaker will draw four 
times more current from a solid state amplifier than from a 16-ohm speaker at 
the same volume (voltage) setting, thus sucking four times more power from the 
amplifier (again at a set volume setting). This helps make the speaker play 
louder in the showroom when it is going up against competitors. I think 
"perceived" efficiency helps sell speakers, and this is why speaker manufactures 
have gone astray. </font></p>
<P><font size="2">This has gotten so out of hand that the speaker industry stopped rating a 
speaker.s "efficiency" and started rating it as speaker "sensitivity", which is 
how loud a speaker will play at a given voltage rating no matter how much 
current (and power) it is sucking out of the amplifier. </font> 
<P><font size="2">This aspect of the speaker industry has got to change back. After meeting 
with and then writing a letter to the Editor of Stereophile on this issue, John 
Atikson has noted in his "Measurements" sections of low impedance speakers, that 
the speaker is actually drawing more power than the 1 watt standard. It's a 
start, so good for him. Below are three examples: </font> 
<P><font size="2">1) July 01, p.65, Martin Logan Prodigy review: </font> 
<P><font size="2">"....indicates it to be, as specified, basically a 4 ohm load through much of 
the audio band. This will mean the speaker will actually draw 2W from the 
amplifier from that voltage level, not 1W." </font> 
<P><font size="2">2) August 01, p.70, Krell LAT-1 review: </font> 
<P><font size="2">"However, as shown by its impedance plot, it is a 4 ohm design, drawing 2W 
rather than 1W from the partnering amplifier to reach this measured 
sensitivity." </font> 
<P><font size="2">3) August 01, p.79, Audio Physic Avanti III review: </font>
<P><font size="2">"...revealed it to a 4 ohm design; ie, it actually draws two watts from the 
amplifier to raise the rated sound pressure level." </font> 
<P><font size="2"><b>Speaker Efficiency vs- Sensitivity</b><BR>Speaker efficiency is not the 
same as speaker sensitivity. Years ago, all speakers were specified as having an 
efficiency rating, now speakers seem to be specified with a sensitivity rating. 
I think that the speaker industry needs to get back to rating a speaker's 
efficiency, or at the very least, we as Audiophiles need to understand the 
difference. </font> 
<P><font size="2">Efficiency is the true measure for speakers. It is like miles/gallon to the 
automobile, but speaker sensitivity is like saying how many miles an automobile 
can go on a tank of gas. If we don't know how many gallons of gas are in the 
tank, it is meaningless in terms of efficiency. This is the speaker industry's 
way of making 4-ohm speakers with 2-ohm impedance dips sound as if they are 
efficient. </font> 
<P><font size="2">Speaker efficiency is specified as sound pressure per watt (like miles per 
gallon of gas). In other words, how much acoustical power is put into the air, 
for how much electrical power is put into the speaker. The rating is typically 
given as dB per 1 watt measured at 1-meter distance. </font> 
<P><font size="2">Speaker sensitivity is specified as sound pressure per volts (like miles per 
tank of gas). In other words, how much acoustical power is put into the air, for 
how much voltage is put into the speaker, regardless of its impedance. The 
rating is typically given as dB per 2.83 volts measured at 1-meter distance.
</font> 
<P><font size="2">It is true that 2.83 volts RMS into 8 ohms is equal to 1 watt of power, but 
now the "sensitivity game" is played and a speaker is said to put out 90dB at 
2.83 volts. The truth is that a 4-ohm speaker at its 2-ohm impedance dip, is 
requiring 4 watts of power, not 1 watt like they would like you to believe.
</font> 
<P><font size="2">It is true that using an autoformer to transform a 4 or 8 ohm speaker into a 
16 ohm speaker will decrease the speaker's sensitivity since it will take more 
voltage (but less current) to achieve 1 watt of power, though the speaker will 
still remain just as efficient. Actually some systems will have the ability to 
play louder if the amplifier being used has a maximum power band curve that 
peaks around 16 ohms. Some OTL examples are the 60-watt Atma-Sphere M-60 that 
will do 80 watts into 16 ohms, and the 25-watt Transcendent Audio Stereo T8 that 
should do 40 watts into 16 ohms. Sure most solid state amplifiers can provide 
more power into a 4-ohm load, but do they sound better that way? My SONY ES 
series receiver sounds a lot better when I increased my speaker's impedance to 
16 ohms. I am also able to listen to the music at louder levels without feeling 
like I want to turn down the volume. Others have reported similar results with 
their solid state amplifiers. </font> 
<P><font size="2"><b>A word of Caution</b><BR>The ZERO autoformer holds the speaker's 
multiplied impedance charter down to 2Hz, yet the low 0.3 ohm DC resistance may 
cause trouble if using a Solid State amplifier with excess offset voltage. As 
little as 300mV of amplifier offset voltage will cause 1 amp of DC current to 
flow. Also, if the SS amplifier's offset voltage changes dynamically with the 
music, a large amount of DC current can flow as well. Because of this, I 
recommend that a fast blow fuse (probably about 3-5A) be installed in series 
between any SS amplifier that is not fault protected, and the autoformer. 
The autoformer will protect the speaker from DC; the fuse is there to protect 
the amp from itself if it does try to push DC. </font> </I></FONT></P>
